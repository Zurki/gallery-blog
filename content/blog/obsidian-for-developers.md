# Obsidian for Developers

Obsidian isn't just for note-taking—it's a powerful tool for developers to organize knowledge, document projects, and maintain a personal wiki.

## Why Obsidian?

### Plain Text Files

Everything is stored as markdown files. This means:

- Version control friendly (Git)
- Future-proof format
- Easy to backup and sync
- No vendor lock-in

### Linking and Graphs

Create connections between notes with `[[wiki-style links]]`. The graph view visualizes your knowledge network.

## Use Cases for Developers

### 1. Project Documentation

Keep all project notes in one vault:

```
projects/
├── project-a/
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── api-docs.md
│   └── meeting-notes.md
└── project-b/
    └── requirements.md
```

### 2. Learning Journal

Document what you learn:

- New programming concepts
- Framework tutorials
- Bug fixes and solutions
- Code snippets

### 3. Code Snippets Library

Store reusable code with syntax highlighting:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

### 4. Interview Prep

Organize:

- Algorithm solutions
- System design patterns
- Behavioral question answers
- Company research

## Plugins for Developers

- **Dataview**: Query your notes like a database
- **Templater**: Automate note creation
- **Git**: Version control integration
- **Advanced Tables**: Better markdown tables

## Tips

1. Use tags for categorization
2. Create daily notes for journaling
3. Link related concepts together
4. Review and refactor your notes regularly

## Conclusion

Obsidian transforms scattered notes into an interconnected knowledge base. Give it a try for your next project!
