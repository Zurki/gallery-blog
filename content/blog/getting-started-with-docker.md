# Getting Started with Docker

Docker has revolutionized how we deploy applications. Let's explore the basics.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers package your application with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.

## Key Concepts

### Images

An image is a blueprint for your container. It contains:

- Your application code
- Runtime environment
- System libraries
- Dependencies

### Containers

A container is a running instance of an image. Think of it as a lightweight virtual machine.

## Basic Commands

Here are some essential Docker commands:

```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx:alpine

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx:alpine

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop <container_id>
```

## Docker Compose

For multi-container applications, Docker Compose simplifies orchestration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Same environment everywhere
- **Isolation**: Each container is independent
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to VMs
- **Portability**: Run anywhere Docker is installed

## Conclusion

Docker is an essential tool for modern development. Start small, experiment, and gradually incorporate it into your workflow.
