# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for an Astro-based static blog system that uses Obsidian for content creation and Docker Compose for deployment. The system will enable users to write blog posts in Markdown using Obsidian, build them into a static website using Astro, and deploy the site via Docker Compose to a server managed by Coolify.

## Glossary

- **Blog System**: The complete application including content management, static site generation, and deployment infrastructure
- **Obsidian**: A markdown-based note-taking application used for content creation
- **Astro**: A static site generator framework that builds the blog website
- **Docker Container**: A containerized environment that runs the static web server
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running the Docker Container configuration
- **Coolify**: A self-hosted platform for deploying and managing applications
- **Static Website**: The generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files served to users
- **Content Directory**: The folder containing markdown blog posts created in Obsidian

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

2. THE Blog System SHALL support standard Markdown syntax including headings, lists, links, images, and code blocks
3. THE Blog System SHALL support frontmatter metadata including title, date, description, and tags
4. WHEN a Markdown file is created in the Content Directory, THE Blog System SHALL recognize it as a valid blog post during the build process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want Astro to automatically convert my Markdown posts into a styled website, so that my content is presented in an attractive and readable format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Astro SHALL generate a Static Website from Markdown files in the Content Directory
2. THE Astro SHALL create an index page listing all blog posts with titles, dates, and descriptions
3. THE Astro SHALL generate individual pages for each blog post with proper formatting
4. THE Astro SHALL apply consistent styling across all generated pages
5. THE Astro SHALL optimize images and assets for web delivery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to containerize the blog using Docker, so that the deployment is consistent and portable across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Blog System SHALL include a Dockerfile that builds the Static Website
2. THE Docker Container SHALL serve the Static Website using a web server
3. THE Docker Container SHALL expose port 80 for HTTP traffic
4. WHEN the Docker Container starts, THE Docker Container SHALL serve the Static Website immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Docker Compose to manage the blog deployment, so that I can easily start, stop, and configure the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Blog System SHALL include a docker-compose.yml file defining the service configuration
2. THE Docker Compose SHALL configure port mappings for web access
3. THE Docker Compose SHALL support environment variable configuration
4. WHEN docker-compose up is executed, THE Docker Compose SHALL build and start the Blog System

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the blog to be compatible with Coolify, so that I can deploy and manage it on my server infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Blog System SHALL include configuration files compatible with Coolify deployment
2. THE Blog System SHALL support deployment via Git repository integration
3. THE Docker Compose configuration SHALL be compatible with Coolify's deployment process
4. THE Blog System SHALL include documentation for Coolify deployment steps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to browse blog posts with a clean interface, so that I can easily find and read content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Static Website SHALL display a homepage with a list of all blog posts
