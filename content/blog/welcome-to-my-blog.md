# Welcome!

This is my first blog post, written in **Obsidian** and published with **Astro**.

[[getting-started-with-docker]]
## Why This Setup?

I chose this combination because:

- **Obsidian** provides an excellent writing experience
- **Markdown** is simple and portable
- **Astro** generates fast, static websites
- **Docker** makes deployment consistent

## Features

This blog supports:

1. Standard markdown formatting
2. Code syntax highlighting
3. Tags for organization
4. Draft posts (hidden from production)

### Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about web development, DevOps, and my learning journey. Stay tuned!
